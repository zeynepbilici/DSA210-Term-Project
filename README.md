# _DSA210-Term-Project_
I am Zeynep Bilici, a CS student at SabancÄ± University, and this is my DSA210 term project. The goal of this project is to analyze data from the Starbucks Mobile App to examine how my coffee consumption changes during the school period based on my course load and exam schedules. I will collect the data from the Starbucks Mobile App manually.

# _Motivation_
Since I know that over caffeine consumption can be harmful to health, I wanted to analyze my coffee consumption during periods of school time. By analyzing the results, I aim to use this project in a way that benefits my well-being and health. Additionally, I want to analyze the patterns in my coffee consumption on days with a low or high course load, as well as on weeks when I have exams.

# _Project Goal_
The goal of this project is to analyze my coffee consumption data from the Starbucks Mobile App to identify the patterns based on my course load and exam periods. My purpose is to find the interaction between higher stress and busier school schedule with caffeine consumption. I aim to determine whether my coffee consumption habits align with healthy limits or not.
