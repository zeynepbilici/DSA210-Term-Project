# DSA210-Term-Project
# I am Zeynep Bilici, a CS student at SabancÄ± University, and this is my DSA210 term project. The goal of this project is to analyze data from the Starbucks Mobile App to examine how my coffee consumption changes during the school period based on my course load and exam schedules. I will collect the data from the Starbucks Mobile App manually.
